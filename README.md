# Flask Template

This repository serves as a development environment template for a Flask application.

## ðŸš€ Setup
Clone this repository using the command below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tomopu/flask_template.git
```

Create a `.env` file and set your Ngrok token by referring to the `.env.sample` file.

---

## ðŸ›  Development

Set up the development environment using `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies with Poetry:

```bash
poetry install
```

To exit the virtual environment, use the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ Usage

To launch the system, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f compose.prod.yaml -f compose.yaml up -d
```

Once the system is running, you can access Ngrok's URL by opening `localhost:4040` in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can start the Flask application directly with:
```bash
python flask-app/app.py
```
When running the Flask application directly, open `localhost:5001` in your web browser to access the system.

### ðŸŽ¯ Notes
- Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed before running the application.
- Modify the `.env` file with your required environment variables before starting the system.
- This template is designed for rapid Flask development and can be customized as needed.
- If you change the `flask-app` directory name, update the following references accordingly:
  - `Dockerfile`
    ```dockerfile
    COPY ./flask-app /src/flask-app/
    ```
    ```dockerfile
    WORKDIR /src/flask-app
    ```
  - `pyproject.toml`
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry]
    name = "flask-app"
    ```
    ```toml
    [[tool.poetry.packages]]
    include = "flask-app"
    ```
